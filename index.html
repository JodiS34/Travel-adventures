            <h2>Why Tulum Mexico?</h2>
            <h3>Tulum is the city of beauty Mayan history</h3>
            <p>
              As recently as the early 1990s, Tulum was a quiet village 2 km
              (1.5 mi) from the archaeological site, and tourism outside of the
              ruins was limited to a few small shops and simple cabanas on the
              beach. As of the 2020 census, population of Tulum municipality has
              grown to 46,721 permanent inhabitants with the addition of a
              number of residential developments in the jungle areas nearest
              Tulum's downtown.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the rapid increase in tourism, vacation rentals, small hotels
              and hostels, as well as restaurants and bars, the town is getting
              more and more popular. Grocery stores, boutiques, bicycle rentals,
              gyms, tour operators, banks, ATMs, internet cafes, and various
              other commercial stores are available in Tulum town. Spanish
              Language Schools are popular in Tulum

              <h4>Onyx Tulum</h4>
              <p>
                Onyx Tulum Restaurant Bar is popular for its energetic and
                festive atmosphere, with live music and performances that many
                travelers enjoy, though some find the music a bit loud. The wait
                time is generally short, and a complimentary drink may be
                offered. Guests frequently praise the delicious, fresh food and
                generous portions, though prices and value receive mixed
                reviews. Service earns rave reviews for attentiveness and
                friendliness, despite occasional concerns about billing
                practices.

                I found that they have vegetarian friendly and vegan options
